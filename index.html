			<p class="with-letter"><span class="letter">M</span>ost frontenders heard bout Sass; some got hooked, many chose Less, and majority stucks with overload informations about how awesome it is, but have no clue in how to start using it on their projects.</p>

			<p>The main goal of this article is to guide frontenders who are interested in using Sass NOW. Yes, you will have a project running Sass within the next 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

			<p>Excited? on fire?! Awesome! Read on!</p>

			<p class="note">Please keep in mind that this article only covers real basic of Sass &amp; Compass for Sass newbies. I am planning on writing more about how to use them in the future, but not in this version.</p>

			<h2>~ Why Sass? ~</h2>
			<p>There are a lot of discussions going on about Sass vs. Less. Most developers I met are on Less' side and
			I would like to persuade them to take a peek a bit on Sass; two of the main reasons are because of <a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a> &amp; also... Sass is more logical.</p>

			<p>Wait... did I hear "Why?!"</p>

			<p>So here is the truth; indeed Less has what Sass has(mixin, extend, you-name-it), but the way Less work is different than Sass.
			I am not planning on explaining the difference here, since there are many other experienced developer out there blogging about this topic.
			One of the best explanations I really like is from <a href="http://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/" target="_blank">Chris Coyier</a>. Take a good read on it, seriously.</p>

			<h2>~ Step by Step ~</h2>
			<p>So you are convinced and want to try Sass now. I assure you this will be super easy and quick, let's do it now.</p>

			<ol class="step-by-step">
				<li>
					<h3>Step 1</h3>
					<p>First things first, let's decide on the compiler. There are several options, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a> compiler</li>
						<li><a href="http://mhs.github.com/scout-app/" target="_blank">Scout App</a>  compiler</li>
						<li><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">CodeKit</a> - an amazing tool for developers. It's not only compiling Sass &amp; Compass but also Haml, Less, Stylus, Jade, &amp; CoffeeScript. They also have a livereload feature, super handy. Def recommended!($25)</li>
						<li>And many other sizzle out there (that I haven't tried)</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="note">* I personally use Compass because it is easier for me and I don't have to install any app on my mac; however I would recommend Scout for people who prefer easy UI(Sass &amp; Compass) - and CodeKit for people who are not only using Sass &amp; Compass but also Haml, CoffeeScript, etc.*</p>

					<p>Using Scout App is super easy, all you have to do is go to their website and download the app. Everything is straight forward: add desired projects on the left(1), configure it on the right(2), and click "Log" on top right to see console messages(3).</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="public/images/scoutapp.jpg" alt="Scout App">
						<figcaption>ScoutApp image: see image 1, 2, &amp; 3</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>Using Compass is slightly different, but equally easy. All you have to do is adding config.rb on your project folder. See below:</p>

					<figure class="config">
						<img src="public/images/config.jpg" alt="config.rb">
						<figcaption>Project structure for Sassify!</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>Then paste the code below on config.rb(please adjust accordingly to your project structure):</p>
					<code>
						<span class="comment"># Require any additional compass plugins here.</span>
						<span class="comment"># Set this to the root of your project when deployed:</span>
						http_path = "/"<br>
						<span class="comment"># Path for images</span>
						http_images_path = "/images/"<br>
						http_generated_images_path = "/images/"<br>
						<br>
						css_dir = "public/css"<br>
						sass_dir = "sass"<br>
						images_dir = "public/images"<br>
						javascripts_dir = "public/js"<br>
						<br>
						output_style = :compressed<br>
						<br>
						<span class="comment"># To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:</span>
						<span class="comment"># relative_assets = true</span>
						<span class="comment"># To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:</span>
						<span class="comment"># line_comments = false</span>
						<span class="comment"># If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this</span>
						<span class="comment"># project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:</span>
						<span class="comment"># preferred_syntax = :sass</span>
						<span class="comment"># and then run:</span>
						<span class="comment"># sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass</span>
					</code>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Step 2</h3>
					<p>After adding config.rb on your project, go to Terminal => project folder => type "compass watch". BAM! Compass is compiling your Sass files.</p>
					<p class="note">* Make sure you already created a sass file inside your sass folder, otherwise you will see error message on terminal when you type "compass watch" *</p>
					<figure class="compasswatch">
						<img src="public/images/compasswatch.jpg" alt="Compass">
						<figcaption>Example, using my Sassify! project</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>Now, let's setup basic Sass for a project.</p>
					<code>
						<span class="comment">
							// Importing Compass
						</span>
						@import "compass"
						<span class="comment">/* Reset is optional */</span>
						@import "compass/reset"
						<br><br>

						<span class="comment">
							// Mixins are defined with the @mixin(also "=") directive. Itâ€™s followed by the name of the mixin and optionally the arguments, and a block containing the contents of the mixin. For better explanation, please go <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#defining_a_mixin" target="_blank">here</a>.
						</span>
						=retina-image($image, $ext, $resolution, $properties: false)<br>
							<span class="indent-1">background: url(../images/#{$image}.#{$ext}) $properties</span>
							<span class="indent-1">@media only screen and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 2)</span>
								<span class="indent-2">background: url(../images/#{$image}_2x.#{$ext}) $properties</span>
								<span class="indent-2">background-size: $resolution</span>
						<br>

						<span class="comment">
							// Fleximage is for fluid image
						</span>
						=fleximage<br>
							<span class="indent-1">max-width: 100%</span>
							<span class="indent-1">width: 100%</span>
							<span class="indent-1">height: auto</span>
						<br>

						<span class="comment">
							// Define variables
						</span>
						$fontFamily: 'Enriqueta', Georgia, serif<br>
						$titleFont: 'Coustard', cursive, Georgia, serif<br>
						$fontColor: #111<br>
						$altColor: #0070b8<br>
						$alertColor: #c30c30<br>
						<br>

						<span class="comment">
							// Text selection styling
						</span>
						body<br>
							<span class="indent-1">font-family: $fontFamily</span>
							<span class="comment indent-1">/* The font-size is now 0.625 * 16px = 10px. */</span>
							<span class="indent-1">font-size: 0.625em</span>
							<span class="comment indent-1">/* The leading is now 25 pixels. */</span>
							<span class="indent-1">line-height: 2.5em</span>
							<span class="indent-1">color: $fontColor</span>
					</code>
				</li>

					<h3>Step 3</h3>
					<p>Congratulation! now you are officially using Sass!
					<span class="note">* imagine me patting each one of you on the back *</span></p>
					<p>The wisest thing to do now is to go <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html" target="_blank">here</a> and dive into Sass a bit. I would suggest to start reading about <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#defining_a_mixin" target="_blank">@mixin</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#extend" target="_blank">@extend</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#media" target="_blank">@media</a>, and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#control_directives" target="_blank">Control Directives</a>.</p>
					<p class="note">* Control Directives are really amazing! See figure below as an example. *</p>

					<figure class="each">

					<p>OK, now the exciting news - one of the major reasons why you should pick Sass: <a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a>!</p>
				</li>

			<h2>~ Compass ~</h2>
			<p>Compass provides cross browser CSS3 mixins, basic mixins for common typography patterns, and basic mixins for common styling patterns. These make things super easy for frontender, here is a simple example below:</p>

			<code>
				.radius-box<br>
				<span class="indent-1">display: inline-block</span>
				<span class="indent-1">padding: 10px</span>
				<span class="indent-1">color: white</span>
				<span class="indent-1">background: black</span>
				<span class="comment indent-1">
					// See explanation <a href="http://compass-style.org/examples/compass/css3/border_radius/" target="_blank">here</a>
				</span>
				<span class="indent-1">+border-radius(5px)</span>
				<span class="comment indent-1">
					// See explanation <a href="http://compass-style.org/examples/compass/css3/gradient/" target="_blank">here</a>
				</span>
				<span class="indent-1">+background-image(linear-gradient(white, #cccccc 30%, #bbbbbb 70%, #aaaaaa))</span>
				<br>
				.intro-text
				<span class="indent-1">font-family: $fontFamily</span>
				<span class="indent-1">font-size: 2em</span>
				<span class="comment indent-1">
					// See explanation <a href="http://compass-style.org/examples/compass/css3/text_shadow/" target="_blank">here</a>
				</span>
				<span class="indent-1">+text-shadow(#rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 0 1px 1px)</span>
