				<h2>~ Why Sass? ~</h2>
				<p>There are a lot of discussion going on about Sass vs. Less. Most developers I met are on Less' side and I would like to persuade them to take a peek a bit on Sass; the main reason is because Sass is more logical.</p>

				<p>Wait... did I hear a "Why?!"</p>

				<p>So here is the truth; Less has what Sass has(mixin, extend, you-name-it) indeed, but the way Less work is different than Sass. I am not planning on telling you the difference here, since there are many other experienced developer out there blogging about this topic. One of the best explanations I really like is from Chris Coyier. Take a good read on it, seriously.</p>

				<h2>~ Convinced! I want it now! ~</h2>
				<p>So your next question would be "How do I use it now?" </p>
